Since all of our group members love music and are enthusiastic about doing research on this topic, we choose to go with it. We have started to look at different datasets which contain lyrics of different popular songs. We have also been looking at other data science projects related to music, for inspiration. The first link below is an example of some of the projects we have been looking at, and the second link contains an example dataset which could be useful for our project.\n",

The data set will tell us the name of the word, the frequency of the word and the frequency of the words for a particular year. Next we will look at the revenue generated by the songs which these words are associated with. This will help us identify which words are contributing to the most revenue generation."
